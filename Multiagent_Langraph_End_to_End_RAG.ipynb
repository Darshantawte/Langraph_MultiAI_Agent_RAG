As you read this essay, you understand each word based on your understanding of previous words. You don’t throw everything away and start thinking from scratch again. Your thoughts have persistence.\\nTraditional neural networks can’t do this, and it seems like a major shortcoming. For example, imagine you want to classify what kind of event is happening at every point in a movie. It’s unclear how a traditional neural network could use its reasoning about previous events in the film to inform later ones.\\nRecurrent neural networks address this issue. They are networks with loops in them, allowing information to persist.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecurrent Neural Networks have loops.\\n\\nIn the above diagram, a chunk of neural network, \\\\(A\\\\), looks at some input \\\\(x_t\\\\) and outputs a value \\\\(h_t\\\\). A loop allows information to be passed from one step of the network to the next.\\nThese loops make recurrent neural networks seem kind of mysterious. However, if you think a bit more, it turns out that they aren’t all that different than a normal neural network. A recurrent neural network can be thought of as multiple copies of the same network, each passing a message to a successor. Consider what happens if we unroll the loop:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn unrolled recurrent neural network.\"),\n",

They’re the natural architecture of neural network to use for such data.\\nAnd they certainly are used! In the last few years, there have been incredible success applying RNNs to a variety of problems: speech recognition, language modeling, translation, image captioning… The list goes on. I’ll leave discussion of the amazing feats one can achieve with RNNs to Andrej Karpathy’s excellent blog post, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks. But they really are pretty amazing.\\nEssential to these successes is the use of “LSTMs,” a very special kind of recurrent neural network which works, for many tasks, much much better than the standard version. Almost all exciting results based on recurrent neural networks are achieved with them. It’s these LSTMs that this essay will explore.\\nThe Problem of Long-Term Dependencies\\nOne of the appeals of RNNs is the idea that they might be able to connect previous information to the present task, such as using previous video frames might inform the understanding of the present frame. If RNNs could do this, they’d be extremely useful. But can they? It depends.\\nSometimes, we only need to look at recent information to perform the present task. For example, consider a language model trying to predict the next word based on the previous ones. If we are trying to predict the last word in “the clouds are in the sky,” we don’t need any further context – it’s pretty obvious the next word is going to be sky. In such cases, where the gap between the relevant information and the place that it’s needed is small, RNNs can learn to use the past information.'),\n",

Consider trying to predict the last word in the text “I grew up in France… I speak fluent French.” Recent information suggests that the next word is probably the name of a language, but if we want to narrow down which language, we need the context of France, from further back. It’s entirely possible for the gap between the relevant information and the point where it is needed to become very large.\\nUnfortunately, as that gap grows, RNNs become unable to learn to connect the information.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn theory, RNNs are absolutely capable of handling such “long-term dependencies.” A human could carefully pick parameters for them to solve toy problems of this form. Sadly, in practice, RNNs don’t seem to be able to learn them. The problem was explored in depth by Hochreiter (1991) [German] and Bengio, et al. (1994), who found some pretty fundamental reasons why it might be difficult.\\nThankfully, LSTMs don’t have this problem!\\nLSTM Networks\\nLong Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. They were introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), and were refined and popularized by many people in following work.1 They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems, and are now widely used.\\nLSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn!\\nAll recurrent neural networks have the form of a chain of repeating modules of neural network. In standard RNNs, this repeating module will have a very simple structure, such as a single tanh layer.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe repeating module in a standard RNN contains a single layer.\\n\\n\\nLSTMs also have this chain like structure, but the repeating module has a different structure. Instead of having a single neural network layer, there are four, interacting in a very special way.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe repeating module in an LSTM contains four interacting layers.'),\n",

We’ll walk through the LSTM diagram step by step later. For now, let’s just try to get comfortable with the notation we’ll be using.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the above diagram, each line carries an entire vector, from the output of one node to the inputs of others. The pink circles represent pointwise operations, like vector addition, while the yellow boxes are learned neural network layers. Lines merging denote concatenation, while a line forking denote its content being copied and the copies going to different locations. \\nThe Core Idea Behind LSTMs\\nThe key to LSTMs is the cell state, the horizontal line running through the top of the diagram.\\nThe cell state is kind of like a conveyor belt. It runs straight down the entire chain, with only some minor linear interactions. It’s very easy for information to just flow along it unchanged.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe LSTM does have the ability to remove or add information to the cell state, carefully regulated by structures called gates.\\nGates are a way to optionally let information through. They are composed out of a sigmoid neural net layer and a pointwise multiplication operation.'),\n",

A value of zero means “let nothing through,” while a value of one means “let everything through!”\\nAn LSTM has three of these gates, to protect and control the cell state.\\nStep-by-Step LSTM Walk Through\\nThe first step in our LSTM is to decide what information we’re going to throw away from the cell state. This decision is made by a sigmoid layer called the “forget gate layer.” It looks at \\\\(h_{t-1}\\\\) and \\\\(x_t\\\\), and outputs a number between \\\\(0\\\\) and \\\\(1\\\\) for each number in the cell state \\\\(C_{t-1}\\\\). A \\\\(1\\\\) represents “completely keep this” while a \\\\(0\\\\) represents “completely get rid of this.”\\nLet’s go back to our example of a language model trying to predict the next word based on all the previous ones. In such a problem, the cell state might include the gender of the present subject, so that the correct pronouns can be used. When we see a new subject, we want to forget the gender of the old subject.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next step is to decide what new information we’re going to store in the cell state. This has two parts. First, a sigmoid layer called the “input gate layer” decides which values we’ll update. Next, a tanh layer creates a vector of new candidate values, \\\\(\\\\tilde{C}_t\\\\), that could be added to the state. In the next step, we’ll combine these two to create an update to the state.\\nIn the example of our language model, we’d want to add the gender of the new subject to the cell state, to replace the old one we’re forgetting.'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': 'https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/', 'title': \"Understanding LSTM Networks -- colah's blog\", 'language': 'en'}, page_content='It’s now time to update the old cell state, \\\\(C_{t-1}\\\\), into the new cell state \\\\(C_t\\\\). The previous steps already decided what to do, we just need to actually do it.\\nWe multiply the old state by \\\\(f_t\\\\), forgetting the things we decided to forget earlier. Then we add \\\\(i_t*\\\\tilde{C}_t\\\\). This is the new candidate values, scaled by how much we decided to update each state value.\\nIn the case of the language model, this is where we’d actually drop the information about the old subject’s gender and add the new information, as we decided in the previous steps.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, we need to decide what we’re going to output. This output will be based on our cell state, but will be a filtered version. First, we run a sigmoid layer which decides what parts of the cell state we’re going to output. Then, we put the cell state through \\\\(\\\\tanh\\\\) (to push the values to be between \\\\(-1\\\\) and \\\\(1\\\\)) and multiply it by the output of the sigmoid gate, so that we only output the parts we decided to.\\nFor the language model example, since it just saw a subject, it might want to output information relevant to a verb, in case that’s what is coming next. For example, it might output whether the subject is singular or plural, so that we know what form a verb should be conjugated into if that’s what follows next.\\n\\n\\n\\nVariants on Long Short Term Memory\\nWhat I’ve described so far is a pretty normal LSTM. But not all LSTMs are the same as the above. In fact, it seems like almost every paper involving LSTMs uses a slightly different version. The differences are minor, but it’s worth mentioning some of them.\\nOne popular LSTM variant, introduced by Gers & Schmidhuber (2000), is adding “peephole connections.” This means that we let the gate layers look at the cell state.'),\n",

Instead of separately deciding what to forget and what we should add new information to, we make those decisions together. We only forget when we’re going to input something in its place. We only input new values to the state when we forget something older.\\n\\n\\n\\nA slightly more dramatic variation on the LSTM is the Gated Recurrent Unit, or GRU, introduced by Cho, et al. (2014). It combines the forget and input gates into a single “update gate.” It also merges the cell state and hidden state, and makes some other changes. The resulting model is simpler than standard LSTM models, and has been growing increasingly popular.'),\n",

There are lots of others, like Depth Gated RNNs by Yao, et al. (2015). There’s also some completely different approach to tackling long-term dependencies, like Clockwork RNNs by Koutnik, et al. (2014).\\nWhich of these variants is best? Do the differences matter? Greff, et al. (2015) do a nice comparison of popular variants, finding that they’re all about the same. Jozefowicz, et al. (2015) tested more than ten thousand RNN architectures, finding some that worked better than LSTMs on certain tasks.\\nConclusion\\nEarlier, I mentioned the remarkable results people are achieving with RNNs. Essentially all of these are achieved using LSTMs. They really work a lot better for most tasks!\\nWritten down as a set of equations, LSTMs look pretty intimidating. Hopefully, walking through them step by step in this essay has made them a bit more approachable.\\nLSTMs were a big step in what we can accomplish with RNNs. It’s natural to wonder: is there another big step? A common opinion among researchers is: “Yes! There is a next step and it’s attention!” The idea is to let every step of an RNN pick information to look at from some larger collection of information. For example, if you are using an RNN to create a caption describing an image, it might pick a part of the image to look at for every word it outputs. In fact, Xu, et al. (2015) do exactly this – it might be a fun starting point if you want to explore attention! There’s been a number of really exciting results using attention, and it seems like a lot more are around the corner…\\nAttention isn’t the only exciting thread in RNN research. For example, Grid LSTMs by Kalchbrenner, et al. (2015) seem extremely promising. Work using RNNs in generative models – such as Gregor, et al. (2015), Chung, et al. (2015), or Bayer & Osendorfer (2015)  – also seems very interesting. The last few years have been an exciting time for recurrent neural networks, and the coming ones promise to only be more so!'),\n",

Almost everything we do is fundamentally very simple. Unfortunately, an innate human handicap interferes with us understanding these simple things.\\nHumans evolved to reason fluidly about two and three dimensions. With some effort, we may think in four dimensions. Machine learning often demands we work with thousands of dimensions – or tens of thousands, or millions! Even very simple things become hard to understand when you do them in very high numbers of dimensions.\\nReasoning directly about these high dimensional spaces is just short of hopeless.\\nAs is often the case when humans can’t directly do something, we’ve built tools to help us. There is an entire, well-developed field, called dimensionality reduction, which explores techniques for translating high-dimensional data into lower dimensional data. Much work has also been done on the closely related subject of visualizing high dimensional data.\\nThese techniques are the basic building blocks we will need if we wish to visualize machine learning, and deep learning specifically. My hope is that, through visualization and observing more directly what is actually happening, we can understand neural networks in a much deeper and more direct way.\\nAnd so, the first thing on our agenda is to familiarize ourselves with dimensionality reduction. To do that, we’re going to need a dataset to test these techniques on.\\nMNIST\\nMNIST is a simple computer vision dataset. It consists of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits, such as:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery MNIST data point, every image, can be thought of as an array of numbers describing how dark each pixel is. For example, we might think of \\\\(\\\\mnist[1]{1}\\\\) as something like:\"),\n",

We can flatten each array into a \\\\(28*28 = 784\\\\) dimensional vector. Each component of the vector is a value between zero and one describing the intensity of the pixel. Thus, we generally think of MNIST as being a collection of 784-dimensional vectors.\\nNot all vectors in this 784-dimensional space are MNIST digits. Typical points in this space are very different! To get a sense of what a typical point looks like, we can randomly pick a few points and examine them. In a random point – a random 28x28 image – each pixel is randomly black, white or some shade of gray. The result is that random points look like noise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImages like MNIST digits are very rare. While the MNIST data points are embedded in 784-dimensional space, they live in a very small subspace. With some slightly harder arguments, we can see that they occupy a lower dimensional subspace.\\nPeople have lots of theories about what sort of lower dimensional structure MNIST, and similar data, have. One popular theory among machine learning researchers is the manifold hypothesis: MNIST is a low dimensional manifold, sweeping and curving through its high-dimensional embedding space. Another hypothesis, more associated with topological data analysis, is that data like MNIST consists of blobs with tentacle-like protrusions sticking out into the surrounding space.\\nBut no one really knows, so lets explore!\\nThe MNIST Cube\\nWe can think of the MNIST data points as points suspended in a 784-dimensional cube. Each dimension of the cube corresponds to a particular pixel. The data points range from zero to one according to the pixels intensity. On one side of the dimension, there are images where that pixel is white. On the other side of the dimension, there are images where it is black. In between, there are images where it is gray.'),\n",

What does the cube look like if we look at a particular two-dimensional face? Like staring into a snow-globe, we see the data points projected into two dimensions, with one dimension corresponding to the intensity of a particular pixel, and the other corresponding to the intensity of a second pixel. Examining this allows us to explore MNIST in a very raw way.\\n In this visualization, each dot is an MNIST data point. The dots are colored based on which class of digit the data point belongs to. When your mouse hovers over a dot, the image for that data point is displayed on each axis. Each axis corresponds to the intensity of a particular pixel, as labeled and visualized as a blue dot in the small image beside it. By clicking on the image, you can change which pixel is displayed on that axis.'),\n",

Looking at pixels \\\\(p_{5,6}\\\\) and \\\\(p_{7,9}\\\\) we can see a lot of twos at the top right and threes at the bottom right.\\nDespite minor successes like these, one can’t really can’t understand MNIST this way. The small insights one gains feel very fragile and feel a lot like luck. The truth is, simply, that very little of MNIST’s structure is visible from these perspectives. You can’t understand images by looking at just two pixels at a time.\\nBut there’s lots of other perspectives we could look at MNIST from! In these perspectives, instead of looking a face straight on, one looks at it from an angle.\\nThe challenge is that we need to choose what perspective we want to use. What angle do we want to look at it from horizontally? What angle do we want to look at it from vertically? Thankfully, there’s a technique called Principal Components Analysis (PCA) that will find the best possible angle for us. By this, we mean that PCA will find the angle that spreads out the points the most (captures the most variance possible).\\nBut, what does it even mean to look at a 784-dimensional cube from an angle? Well, we need to decide which direction every axis of the cube should be tilted: to one side, to the other, or somewhere in between?\\nTo be concrete, the following are pictures of the two angles PCA chooses. Red represents tilting a pixel’s dimension to one side, blue to the other.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nIf an MNIST digit primarily highlights red, it ends up on one side.

Unfortunately, even looking at the data from the best angle, MNIST data doesn’t line up nicely for us to look at. It’s a non-trivial high-dimensional structure, and these sorts of linear projections just aren’t going to cut it.\\nThankfully, we have some powerful tools for dealing with datasets which are… uncooperative.\\nOptimization-Based Dimensionality Reduction\\nWhat would we consider a success? What would it mean to have the ‘perfect’ visualization of MNIST? What should our goal be?\\nOne really nice property would be if the distances between points in our visualization were the same as the distances between points in the original space. If that was true, we’d be capturing the global geometry of the data.\\nLet’s be a bit more precise. For any two MNIST data points, \\\\(x_i\\\\) and \\\\(x_j\\\\), there are two notions of distance between them. One is the distance between them in the original space1 and one is the distance between them in our visualization. We will use \\\\(d^*_{i,j}\\\\) to denote the distance between \\\\(x_i\\\\) and \\\\(x_j\\\\) in the original space and \\\\(d_{i,j}\\\\) to denote the distance between \\\\(x_i\\\\) and \\\\(x_j\\\\) in our visualization. Now we can define a cost:\\n\\\\[C = \\\\sum_{i\\\\neq j} ~(d^{*}_{i,j} - d_{i,j})^2\\\\]\\nThis value describes how bad a visualization is. It basically says: “It’s bad for distances to not be the same. In fact, it’s quadratically bad.” If it’s high, it means that distances are dissimilar to the original space. If it’s small, it means they are similar. If it is zero, we have a ‘perfect’ embedding.\\nThat sounds like an optimization problem! And deep learning researchers know what to do with those! We pick a random starting point and apply gradient descent. 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVisualizing MNIST with MDS'),\n",

If you like, there’s a more physical description of what’s going on. First, we randomly position each point on a plane. Next we connect each pair of points with a spring with the length of the original distance, \\\\(d^{*}_{i,j}\\\\). Then we let the points move freely and allow physics to take its course!\\nWe don’t reach a cost of zero, of course. Generally, high-dimensional structures can’t be embedded in two dimensions in a way that preserves distances perfectly. We’re demanding the impossible! But, even though we don’t get a perfect answer, we do improve a lot on the original random embedding, and come to a decent visualization. We can see the different classes begin to separate, especially the ones.\\nSammon’s Mapping\\nStill, it seems like we should be able to do much better. Perhaps we should consider different cost functions? There’s a huge space of possibilities. To start, there’s a lot of variations on MDS. A common theme is cost functions emphasizing local structure as more important to maintain than global structure. A very simple example of this is Sammon’s Mapping, defined by the cost function:\\n\\\\[C = \\\\sum_{i\\\\neq j} \\\\frac{(d^{*}_{i,j} - d_{i,j})^2}{d^{*}_{i,j}}\\\\]\\nIn Sammon’s mapping, we try harder to preserve the distances between nearby points than between those which are far apart. If two points are twice as close in the original space as two others, it is twice as important to maintain the distance between them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVisualizing MNIST with Sammon’s Mapping'),\n",

The reason has to do with a rather unintuitive property regarding distances in high-dimensional data like MNIST. Let’s consider the distances between some MNIST digits. For example, the distance between the similar ones, \\\\(\\\\mnist{6}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mnist{8}\\\\), is \\\\[d(\\\\mnist{6}, \\\\mnist{8}) = 4.53\\\\] On the other hand, the difference between the very different data points, \\\\(\\\\mnist{4}\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mnist{12}\\\\), is \\\\[d(\\\\mnist{4}, \\\\mnist{12}) = 12.0\\\\] less than three times \\\\(d(\\\\mnist{6}, \\\\mnist{8})\\\\)!\\nBecause there’s so many ways similar points can be slightly different, the average distance between similar points is quite high. Conversely, as you get further away from a point, the amount of volume within that distance increases to an extremely high power, and so you are likely to run into different kinds of points. The result is that, in pixel space, the difference in distances between ‘similar’ and ‘different’ points can be much less than we’d like, even in good cases.\\nGraph Based Visualization\\nPerhaps, if local behavior is what we want our embedding to preserve, we should optimize for that more explicitly.\\nConsider a nearest neighbor graph of MNIST. For example, consider a graph \\\\((V,E)\\\\) where the nodes are MNIST data points, and each point is connected to the three points that are closest to it in the original space.3 This graph is a simple way to encode local structure and forget about everything else.\\nGiven such a graph, we can use standard graph layout algorithms to visualize MNIST. Here, we will use force-directed graph drawing: we pretend that all points are repelling charged particles, and that the edges are springs. This gives us a cost function:\\n\\\\[C~ = ~\\\\sum_{i\\\\neq j}\\\\frac{1}{d_{i,j}} ~+~ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{(i,j) \\\\in E} (d_{i,j} - d^{*}_{i,j})^2\\\\]\\nWhich we minimize.'),\n",

In particular, it seems to find the different MNIST classes. While they overlap, during the graph layout optimization we can see the clusters sliding over each other. They are unable to avoid overlapping when embedded on the plane due to connections between classes, but the cost function is at least trying to separate them.\\nOne nice property of the graph visualization is that it explicitly shows us which points are connected to which other points. In earlier visualizations, if we see a point in a strange place, we are uncertain as to whether it’s just stuck there, or if it should actually be there. The graph structure avoids this. For example, if you look at the red cluster of zeros, you will see a single blue point, the six \\\\(\\\\mnist{494}\\\\), among them. You can see from its neighbors that it is supposed to be there, and from looking at it you can see that it is, in fact, a very poorly written six that looks more like a zero.\\n\\n\\n\\nt-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding\\nThe final technique I wish to introduce is the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). This technique is extremely popular in the deep learning community. Unfortunately, t-SNE’s cost function involves some non-trivial mathematical machinery and requires some significant effort to understand.\\nBut, roughly, what t-SNE tries to optimize for is preserving the topology of the data. For every point, it constructs a notion of which other points are its ‘neighbors,’ trying to make all points have the same number of neighbors. Then it tries to embed them so that those points all have the same number of neighbors.\\nIn some ways, t-SNE is a lot like the graph based visualization. But instead of just having points be neighbors (if there’s an edge) or not neighbors (if there isn’t an edge), t-SNE has a continuous spectrum of having points be neighbors to different extents.\\nt-SNE is often very successful at revealing clusters and subclusters in data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVisualizing MNIST with t-SNE'),\n",

It seems that in MNIST, the primary factor of variation in the ones is tilting. This is likely because MNIST normalizes digits in a number of ways, centering and scaling them. After that, the easiest way to be “far apart” is to rotate and not overlap very much.\\nSimilar structure can be observed in other classes, if you look at the t-SNE plot again.\\nVisualization in Three Dimensions\\nWatching these visualizations, there’s sometimes this sense that they’re begging for another dimension. For example, watching the graph visualization optimize, one can see clusters slide over top of each other.\\nReally, we’re trying to compress this extremely high-dimensional structure into two dimensions. It seems natural to think that there would be very big wins from adding an additional dimension. If nothing else, at least in three dimensions a line connecting two clusters doesn’t divide the plane, precluding other connections between clusters.\\nIn the following visualization, we construct a nearest neighbor graph of MNIST, as before, and optimize the same cost function.

There are hundreds of techniques and variants that are unmentioned here. I encourage you to explore!\\nIt’s easy to slip into a mind set of thinking one of these techniques is better than the others, but I think they’re all complementary. There’s no way to map high-dimensional data into low dimensions and preserve all the structure. So, an approach must make trade-offs, sacrificing one property to preserve another. PCA tries to preserve linear structure, MDS tries to preserve global geometry, and t-SNE tries to preserve topology (neighborhood structure).\\nThese techniques give us a way to gain traction on understanding high-dimensional data. While directly trying to understand high-dimensional data with the human mind is all but hopeless, with these tools we can begin to make progress.\\nIn the next post, we will explore applying these techniques to some different kinds of data – in particular, to visualizing representations of text. Then, equipped with these techniques, we will shift our focus to understanding neural networks themselves, visualizing how they transform high-dimensional data and building techniques to visualize the space of neural networks.

As a ...\" response; (2) run one descent step on a refusal response and an ascend step on a red-team bad response per training step. The method (2) ends up being quite useless because the model generation quality degrades a lot, while the drop in attack success rate is tiny.\\nWhite-box attacks often lead to nonsensical adversarial prompts and thus they can be detected by examining perplexity. Of course, a white-box attack can directly bypass this by explicitly optimizing for lower perplexity, such as UAT-LM, a variation of UAT. However, there is a tradeoff and it can lead to lower attack success rate.\\n\\nFig. 18. Perplexity filter can block attacks by [Zou et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043). \"PPL Passed\" and \"PPL Window Passed\" are the rates at which harmful prompts with an adversarial suffix bypass the filter without detection. The lower the pass rate the better the filter is. (Image source: Jain et al. 2023)\\nJain et al. 2023 also tested methods of preprocessing text inputs to remove adversarial modifications while semantic meaning remains.'),\n",
